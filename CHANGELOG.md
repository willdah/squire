## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Google ADK-based agent with LiteLLM for multi-model support.
- Textual TUI with chat pane, status panel, and approval modal.
- 8 system tools: `system_info`, `network_info`, `docker_ps`, `docker_logs`, `docker_compose`, `read_config`, `journalctl`, `run_command`.
- Layered risk evaluation system extracted into standalone `agent-risk-engine` package with zero dependencies. Four-layer pipeline: RuleGate (fully implemented), ToolAnalyzer, StateMonitor, ActionGate (stub interfaces). Integer 1-5 risk levels with threshold aliases (`read-only`, `cautious`, `standard`, `full-trust`). Per-tool overrides via `[risk]` TOML section with `allow`, `approve`, `deny` lists.
- Streaming LLM responses in the TUI — tokens appear as they arrive instead of buffering the full response. Streaming bubbles show a yellow border while in progress. Falls back to buffered display if the provider doesn't support streaming.
- Auto-snapshot on conversation start populates system context.
- Pydantic BaseSettings config with TOML loading and env var overrides.
- `SystemBackend` protocol abstraction with `LocalBackend` implementation.
- SQLite persistence for sessions, messages, snapshots, and events.
- Log viewer panel in the TUI.
- Session resume via `squire chat --resume`.
- Async webhook notifications for tool calls and errors.
- Pre-configured Squire personality profiles: Rook (methodical and cautious), Cedric (bold and direct), Wynn (wise and curious). Select via `squire_profile` config.
- Custom squire naming via `squire_name` config, with "Rook" as the default.
- House identity config (`house`) for personalized agent context.
- Multi-machine architecture design doc (`docs/design/multi-machine.md`).
- Dockerfile for containerized deployment.
- MIT license.

### Changed

- Improved system prompt for conversational intelligence — Squire now matches its response to user intent (greetings get greetings, not system dumps). Reordered prompt sections so behavioral guidance comes before system data. Personality profiles now include conversational hints for greetings.
- Tool calls and results no longer clutter the main chat — they appear only in the activity log.

### Fixed

- Test isolation — config tests no longer pick up local `squire.toml` file.
